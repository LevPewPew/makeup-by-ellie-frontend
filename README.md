## Project Management and Task Delegation

### Kanban board

A Kanban board was used for agile project management and task delegation with a common lane setup as described here:
https://www.atlassian.com/agile/tutorials/how-to-do-kanban-with-jira-software

We also added two additional lanes, "Info to Know" and "Credentials and ENV". These lanes provide a common source of truth for general information we all need to be aware of, without the need to use yet another app such as Google Sheets, or having to wade through Slack conversation history.

Tasks delegated as seen by avatar icons, chosen by strengths and weaknesses of team members and project/team conditions. Difficulty of each task placed into card title. Task delegation worked well so as to ensure we didn't accidentally do any overlapping work by checking who has picked up what card.

Completed tasks marked with link to github commit that merges the relevent branch into master.

When a task is complete, if a Github Pull Request has been made that includes that task, we used labels to indicate that so that we would be aware of what needs an approval before being merged. This was useful as it can be easy to miss a Github notification, where as we were constantly looking at and using our Kanban board. We also had a label to indicate a branch that covers a task has been merged, so that we could pull the latest changes and use them.
