# Tech Stack:
The technology stack is a set of tools and frameworks that are used in the development of a software product. In web development, the technology stack consists of a very specific set of components that work together to create a functioning web application.

The project is implemented using the MERN stack (MongoDb, Express, React, NodeJS), and are used in either  frontend or backend development. Each technology and how it fits in the stack, is detailed below:

## Front End/Client Side
React - React is a javascript library which allows us to create front-end/client side applications, utilising the below to produce a working and styled user interface (UI):
- HTML/JSX
- CSS/SASS
- JavaScript

## Back End/Server Side
- NodeJS - A runtime environment, which is part of MERN stack to allow javascript code to be executed without a browser
- Express - Web Server for processing browser requests. It is a framework built on top of NodeJS
- MongoDB - Database for storing application specific data. A NoSQL database that uses documents to store application related data
- macOS - Operating system in which the development is done

## Project Management and Task Delegation

A Kanban board was used for agile project management and task delegation with a common lane setup as described here:
https://www.atlassian.com/agile/tutorials/how-to-do-kanban-with-jira-software

We also added two additional lanes, "Info to Know" and "Credentials and ENV". These lanes provide a common source of truth for general information we all need to be aware of, without the need to use yet another app such as Google Sheets, or having to wade through Slack conversation history.

Tasks delegated as seen by avatar icons, chosen by strengths and weaknesses of team members and project/team conditions. Difficulty of each task placed into card title. Task delegation worked well so as to ensure we didn't accidentally do any overlapping work by checking who has picked up what card. This can be seen using this link: [Project Management - Board 5](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VH3Qve9jZAMcHWO1utA4G9ge8ArU4s08)

Completed tasks marked with link to github commit that merges the relevant branch into master can be seen using the links below:

[Project Management - Board 6](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1K9YqzVeVDAJWCBtThQFmKYxeH40e0FKG)<br/>
[Project Management - Board 7](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bc4py1C8uT8_O0JBme9-n84PrUzsYLaD)

When a task is complete, if a Github Pull Request has been made that includes that task, we used labels to indicate that so that we would be aware of what needs an approval before being merged. This was useful as it can be easy to miss a Github notification, where as we were constantly looking at and using our Kanban board. We also had a label to indicate a branch that covers a task has been merged, so that we could pull the latest changes and use them, as can be seen here: [Project Management - Board 8](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1K77plthI8tjziXcN8laFWPUa0IIr7qei)


## Packages used
### Testing-library/react, version: 9.4.0
The React Testing Library is used for testing React components. It includes utility functions on top of react-dom and react-dom/test-utils, in order to guide better testing practices. It is designed to run tests which resemble the way that software is used 
We have used this library's render and fireEvent methods to test that the navbar links render the appropriate page, for example. 

### Jest, with testing-library/jest-dom, version: 5.0.2
Jest is used for unit tests of logic and components and not the dom, running tests in the node environment instead of the browser in order to run tests at speed and avoid unreliable results. The library includes a set of custom jest matchers which are used to provide the expected results, such as toBe, or toEqual, making tests clear to read and maintain.
We have used this library in our unit tests including our Service.test file for example, to ensure that our dummyData has been rendered to the screen.

### Axios, version: 0.19.1
Axios is a library that helps to make http requests to external resources.  
We have used this library to make GET and POST requests to our external database collections within Mongo Atlas DB and Amazon.  The website makes multiple GET requests from the root file App.jsx, to access and data from the portfolio, services, contact and faq collections, as well as POST requests to handle form submissions for posts and updates to data.

### Axios-mock-adapter, version: 1.17.0
With Axios-mock-adapter in place, any GET request made to the database within our test code will be intercepted, and instead of actually making a request to the API, it is going to return the data we put into the dummyData. Without the Axios Mock Adapter, the test would run slow, could potentially be unreliable and can result in a network error that may crash the test.

### react-widgets": "^4.4.11"
React Widgets are a library of reusable components made for React.  This website utilises a dropdown field within the redux forms.

### Xxhashjs, version: 0.2.2
xxHashjs is a hashing package containing an algorithm which has been utilised in this website to hash file names of uploaded images, avoiding any name conflicts the user may have encountered.

### Node-sass, version: 4.13.1

Emails can be styled and populated with information submitted as can be seen in these examples:[Nodemailer Email Screenshot 1](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1p4PR0-E5KhIIvQX-FkygjzOnhIBjeWLE),[Nodemailer Email Screenshot 2](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rRs-PVMA096EoQzMTw0HXhYWYQHmka5z)

### React-dom, version: 16.12.0
This package is the 'entry-point' to the DOM enabling efficient management of DOM elements in a web page by utilising the built in methods.

### Yarn Autoclean
Yarn Autoclean was used to remove unused (prune) js files within dependent libraries, saving over 19 MB. To ensure that the pruning didn't damage any of the functionality of the application, a full user experience run-through was done, testing all active links, rendering of collections, as well as CRUD functionality in the Admin pages before it was implemented. <br/>
