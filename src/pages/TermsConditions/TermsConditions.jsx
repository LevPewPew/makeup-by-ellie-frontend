          <li>
            A Non-refundable/non-transferable booking fee of $100 is required to
            secure your event/wedding date.
          </li>
          <li>
            The event/wedding date booking will not be secured until a booking
            fee is paid. In some cases, the booking fee may need to be paid
            before your trial to ensure your wedding date is secured.
          </li>
          <li>
            Final payment of your invoice is due 2 weeks prior to your wedding
            or event date when paying via bank transfer or on the wedding or
            event day when paying by cash.
          </li>
          <li>
            Payment for extra services is due on the day and is payable in cash
            (e.g. extra people).

            A 15% surcharge will be applied to the total for early morning start
            times of 6.30am or earlier.

        <h3>Cancellations and Changes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Any reductions in the booked number of people for you wedding will
            still need to be paid for in full, if less than 1 month’s notice is
            given. If your booking is for an event only, less than 2 week’s
            notice will require full payment. This is to prevent cancellations
            close to or on the date which will otherwise result in a loss of
            other potential work that could have been booked.
          </li>
          <li>
            If reductions in numbers fall below minimum call out you will be
            required to travel to my studio for your services or pay the minimum
            services required for travel.
          </li>
          <li>
            Please notify me of any location changes as soon as possible, this
            may change your quote due to travel fee’s/early start etc. I will
            send you a revised quote if this is the case.
          </li>
          <li>
            On occasion I may have other bookings before or after your event, it
            is imperative that you and your party are on time to receive their
            services. For each 15 minutes that I am held up I will charge $25.
            This will be paid immediately once the job is done via cash or bank
            transfer.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            At the trial you will be given instructions on what is required
            regarding hair and makeup preparation during the weeks/months before
            and on the day. If this advice is not followed then additional costs
            may be charged on the day (eg. if hair is still wet and I need to do
            a full blow dry prior to an upstyle/downstyle)
          </li>
          <li>

            zone to ensure that myself and my working kit are kept smoke free
            and ready for my next clients. I will refuse to work in a smoking
            environment.
